## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Search Tools

fuzzy file and content search tools alongside Pi's built-in find/grep.

#### Scenario: Additive search

  additional tools

- **AND** replacing the built-in names SHALL require an explicit override
  mode

- **THEN** the result SHALL include a cursor for fetching the next page

The catalog SHALL be the exported `PACKAGES` array in `bin/lazypi.mjs`; every
entry SHALL carry `id`, `category`, `source`, `description`, and `hint`, and
MAY carry `legacySources` and `forked`.

#### Scenario: Lean catalog shape

- **THEN** it SHALL contain exactly 16 entries across the categories `core`,
  `tools`, `research`, and `themes`
- **AND** `core` SHALL contain subagents, pi-ask-user, pi-skillful,
  mention-skill, skill-args, goal, btw, context-usage, and simplify
- **AND** `tools` SHALL contain web-access, memory, mcp, interactive-shell,
  and fff
- **AND** `research` SHALL contain ralph-wiggum
- **AND** `themes` SHALL contain curated-themes only

#### Scenario: Side chat best alternative

- **WHEN** the catalog defines `btw`
- **THEN** its `source` SHALL be `npm:@narumitw/pi-btw`
- **AND** the replaced `npm:pi-btw` SHALL remain in `legacySources`

#### Scenario: Dropped packages

- **WHEN** a package was deliberately removed
